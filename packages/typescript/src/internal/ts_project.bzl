    """Compiles one TypeScript project using `tsc --project`

    This is a drop-in replacement for the `tsc` rule automatically generated for the "typescript"
    package, typically loaded from `@npm//typescript:index.bzl`. Unlike bare `tsc`, this rule understands
    the Bazel interop mechanism (Providers) so that this rule works with others that produce or consume
    TypeScript typings (`.d.ts` files).

    Unlike `ts_library`, this rule is the thinnest possible layer of Bazel interoperability on top
    of the TypeScript compiler. It shifts the burden of configuring TypeScript into the tsconfig.json file.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/docs/TypeScript.md#alternatives
    for more details about the trade-offs between the two rules.

    Some TypeScript options affect which files are emitted, and Bazel wants to know these ahead-of-time.
    So several options from the tsconfig file must be mirrored as attributes to ts_project.
    See https://www.typescriptlang.org/v2/en/tsconfig for a listing of the TypeScript options.

    Any code that works with `tsc` should work with `ts_project` with a few caveats:

    - Bazel requires that the `outDir` (and `declarationDir`) be set to
      `bazel-out/[target architecture]/bin/path/to/package`
      so we override whatever settings appear in your tsconfig.
    - Bazel expects that each output is produced by a single rule.
      Thus if you have two `ts_project` rules with overlapping sources (the same `.ts` file
      appears in more than one) then you get an error about conflicting `.js` output
      files if you try to build both together.
      Worse, if you build them separately then the output directory will contain whichever
      one you happened to build most recently. This is highly discouraged.

    > Note: in order for TypeScript to resolve relative references to the bazel-out folder,
    > we recommend that the base tsconfig contain a rootDirs section that includes all
    > possible locations they may appear.
    >
    > We hope this will not be needed in some future release of TypeScript.
    > Follow https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37257 for more info.
    >
    > For example, if the base tsconfig file relative to the workspace root is
    > `path/to/tsconfig.json` then you should configure like:
    >
    > ```
    > "compilerOptions": {
    >     "rootDirs": [
    >         ".",
    >         "../../bazel-out/darwin-fastbuild/bin/path/to",
    >         "../../bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/path/to",
    >         "../../bazel-out/x64_windows-fastbuild/bin/path/to",
    >         "../../bazel-out/darwin-dbg/bin/path/to",
    >         "../../bazel-out/k8-dbg/bin/path/to",
    >         "../../bazel-out/x64_windows-dbg/bin/path/to",

    ### Issues when running non-sandboxed

    When using a non-sandboxed spawn strategy (which is the default on Windows), you may
    observe these problems which require workarounds:

    1) Bazel deletes outputs from the previous execution before running `tsc`.
       This causes a problem with TypeScript's incremental mode: if the `.tsbuildinfo` file
       is not known to be an output of the rule, then Bazel will leave it in the output
       directory, and when `tsc` runs, it may see that the outputs written by the prior
       invocation are up-to-date and skip the emit of these files. This will cause Bazel
       to intermittently fail with an error that some outputs were not written.
       This is why we depend on `composite` and/or `incremental` attributes to be provided,
       so we can tell Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output to ensure it is deleted before a
       subsequent compilation.
       At present, we don't do anything useful with the `.tsbuildinfo` output, and this rule
       does not actually have incremental behavior. Deleting the file is actually
       counter-productive in terms of TypeScript compile performance.
       Follow https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1726

    2) When using Project References, TypeScript will expect to verify that the outputs of referenced
       projects are up-to-date with respect to their inputs.
       (This is true even without using the `--build` option).
       When using a non-sandboxed spawn strategy, `tsc` can read the sources from other `ts_project`
       rules in your project, and will expect that the `tsconfig.json` file for those references will
       indicate where the outputs were written. However the `outDir` is determined by this Bazel rule so
       it cannot be known from reading the `tsconfig.json` file.
       This problem is manifested as a TypeScript diagnostic like
       `error TS6305: Output file '/path/to/execroot/a.d.ts' has not been built from source file '/path/to/execroot/a.ts'.`
       As a workaround, you can give the Windows "fastbuild" output directory as the `outDir` in your tsconfig file.
       On other platforms, the value isn't read so it does no harm.
       See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/packages/typescript/test/ts_project as an example.
       We hope this will be fixed in a future release of TypeScript;
       follow https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37378

    3) When TypeScript encounters an import statement, it adds the source file resolved by that reference
       to the program. However you may have included that source file in a different project, so this causes
       the problem mentioned above where a source file is in multiple programs.
       (Note, if you use Project References this is not the case, TS will know the referenced
       file is part of the other program.)
       This will result in duplicate emit for the same file, which produces an error
       since the files written to the output tree are read-only.
       Workarounds include using using Project References, or simply grouping the whole compilation
       into one program (if this doesn't exceed your time budget).

    Args:
        name: A name for the target.

            We recommend you use the basename (no `.json` extension) of the tsconfig file that should be compiled.

        srcs: List of labels of TypeScript source files to be provided to the compiler.

            If absent, defaults to `**/*.ts[x]` (all TypeScript files in the package).

        deps: List of labels of other rules that produce TypeScript typings (.d.ts files)

        tsconfig: Label of the tsconfig.json file to use for the compilation.

            By default, we add `.json` to the `name` attribute.

        extends: List of labels of tsconfig file(s) referenced in `extends` section of tsconfig.

            Must include any tsconfig files "chained" by extends clauses.

        args: List of strings of additional command-line arguments to pass to tsc.

        tsc: Label of the TypeScript compiler binary to run.

            Override this if your npm_install or yarn_install isn't named "npm"
            For example, `tsc = "@my_deps//typescript/bin:tsc"`
            Or you can pass a custom compiler binary instead.

        declaration: if the `declaration` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.d.ts` output for each `.ts` source.
        source_map: if the `sourceMap` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.js.map` output for each `.ts` source.
        declaration_map: if the `declarationMap` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.d.ts.map` output for each `.ts` source.
        composite: if the `composite` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output and a `.d.ts` output for each `.ts` source.
        incremental: if the `incremental` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel to expect a `.tsbuildinfo` output.
        emit_declaration_only: if the `emitDeclarationOnly` bit is set in the tsconfig.
            Instructs Bazel *not* to expect `.js` or `.js.map` outputs for `.ts` sources.
