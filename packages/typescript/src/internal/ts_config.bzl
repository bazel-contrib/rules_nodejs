Normally, you just give a single `tsconfig.json` file as the tsconfig attribute
of a `ts_library` rule. However, if your `tsconfig.json` uses the `extends`
feature from TypeScript, then the Bazel implementation needs to know about that
extended configuration file as well, to pass them both to the TypeScript compiler.
