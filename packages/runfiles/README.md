# @bazel/runfiles

This package provides a basic set of utilities for resolving runfiles within Node.js scripts
executed through `js_binary` or `js_test`.

Runfile resolution is desirable if your workspace intends to support users that cannot rely
on runfile forest symlinking (most commonly affected are Windows machines).
