"""NodeJS testing

These rules let you run tests using the Mocha library.

Unlike the typical mocha testing setup, we do not use the mocha binary that is
provided by the mocha library. The method used by these rules to patch the
module loader with extra module name -> path mappings (node_loader.js) does not
persist across processes. The mocha binary provided by the mocha library
ultimately spawns a new process to run the actual tests, and so the patched
module loader will not be respected. This approach instead programmatically runs
the Mocha library on the desired files; see
https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/Using-mocha-programmatically.
