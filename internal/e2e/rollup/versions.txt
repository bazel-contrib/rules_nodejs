# Normally this file should be generated via Bazel as follows:
#
# 1) tools/bazel.rc should set this command
#   build --workspace_status_command=./tools/bazel_stamp_vars.sh
#
# 2) tools/bazel_stamp_vars.sh is a script that exports some variables:
#   #!/usr/bin/env bash
#   BUILD_SCM_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=7 --tags HEAD)
#
# 3) a genrule() with stamp=True can read the result
#   native.genrule(
#     name = "my_stamp_data",
#     outs = ["stamp_data.txt"],
#     stamp = True,
#     cmd = "cat bazel-out/volatile-status.txt > $@",
#   )
# 4) Now you can pass this value to the stamp_data attribute of rollup_bundle:
#    stamp_data = ":stamp_data.txt"
#
# See https://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2017/03/27/stamping-your-builds/

# For this test, we just hard-code a value:
BUILD_SCM_VERSION 1.2.3
