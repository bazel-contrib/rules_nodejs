"""NodeModuleInfo & NodeModuleSources providers and apsect to collect node_modules from deps.
"""

# NodeModuleInfo provider is only provided by targets that are npm dependencies by the
# `node_module_library` rule. This provider is currently used by different rules to filter out
# npm dependencies such as
# ```
# [d for d in ctx.attr.deps if not NodeModuleInfo in d]
# ```
# in `packages/typescript/internal/build_defs.bzl` or
# ```
# hasattr(target, "files") and not NodeModuleInfo in target:
# ```
# in `internal/common/sources_aspect.bzl`.
# Similar filtering is done in downstream repositories such as angular/angular so this provider
# needs to go through a deprecation period before it can be phased out.
