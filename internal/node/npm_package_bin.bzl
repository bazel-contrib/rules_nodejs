    """Run an arbitrary npm package binary (e.g. a program under node_modules/.bin/*) under Bazel.

    It must produce outputs. If you just want to run a program with `bazel run`, use the nodejs_binary rule.

    This is like a genrule() except that it runs our launcher script that first
    links the node_modules tree before running the program.

    This is a great candidate to wrap with a macro, as documented:
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/macros.html#full-example

    Args:
        data: similar to [genrule.srcs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule.srcs)
              may also include targets that produce or reference npm packages which are needed by the tool
        outs: similar to [genrule.outs](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule.outs)
        output_dir: set to True if you want the output to be a directory
                 Exactly one of `outs`, `output_dir` may be used.
                 If you output a directory, there can only be one output, which will be a directory named the same as the target.

        args: Command-line arguments to the tool.

            Subject to 'Make variable' substitution. See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/make-variables.html.

            1. Predefined source/output path substitions is applied first:

            See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/make-variables.html#predefined_label_variables.

            Use $(execpath) $(execpaths) to expand labels to the execroot (where Bazel runs build actions).

            Use $(rootpath) $(rootpaths) to expand labels to the runfiles path that a built binary can use
            to find its dependencies.

            Since npm_package_bin is used primarily for build actions, in most cases you'll want to
            use $(execpath) or $(execpaths) to expand locations.

            Using $(location) and $(locations) expansions is not recommended as these are a synonyms
            for either $(execpath) or $(rootpath) depending on the context.

            2. "Make" variables are expanded second:

            Predefined "Make" variables such as $(COMPILATION_MODE) and $(TARGET_CPU) are expanded.
            See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/make-variables.html#predefined_variables.

            Like genrule, you may also use some syntax sugar for locations.

            - `$@`: if you have only one output file, the location of the output
            - `$(@D)`: The output directory. If output_dir=False and there is only one file name in outs, this expands to the directory
                containing that file. If there are multiple files, this instead expands to the package's root directory in the genfiles
                tree, even if all generated files belong to the same subdirectory! If output_dir=True then this corresponds
                to the output directory which is the $(RULEDIR)/{target_name}.
            - `$(RULEDIR)`: the root output directory of the rule, corresponding with its package
                (can be used with output_dir=True or False)

            See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/make-variables.html#predefined_genrule_variables.

            Custom variables are also expanded including variables set through the Bazel CLI with --define=SOME_VAR=SOME_VALUE.
            See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/make-variables.html#custom_variables.

        package: an npm package whose binary to run, like "terser". Assumes your node_modules are installed in a workspace called "npm"
        package_bin: the "bin" entry from `package` that should be run. By default package_bin is the same string as `package`
        tool: a label for a binary to run, like `@npm//terser/bin:terser`. This is the longer form of package/package_bin.
              Note that you can also refer to a binary in your local workspace.
