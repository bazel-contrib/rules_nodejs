# This shell script is a minimal fixture for the launcher.sh script
# with a critical difference: instead of calling the loader.js script
# with the users program passed as an argument (allowing us to patch the node
# loader), this one just runs vanilla node with the users program as the argument
# which lets us assert that the linker is the reason the program works.
