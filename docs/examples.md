# Frameworks

## Angular

Bazel can run any toolchain you want, so there is more than one way to use it with Angular.

**Architect**: The first approach is the simplest: use Architect (aka. Angular CLI Builders). This is the build tool inside of Angular CLI, so your existing application will continue to work the same way. However, it has the worst performance because the level of incrementality is only as fine as how many libs your application is composed from.

Example: [examples/angular_bazel_architect](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/angular_bazel_architect)

**Google**: This toolchain is what we originally advertised as "Angular, Bazel and CLI" (ABC). It is based on Google's internal toolchain for building Angular, and has good performance characteristics. However it is harder to migrate to, because it doesn't have good compatibility for existing applications.

The example has its own guide: [examples/angular](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/angular)

**View Engine**: If you're stuck on the older Angular compiler/runtime before Ivy, called View Engine, then your options are more limited. We don't support Angular 9 + View Engine + Bazel.

Example: [examples/angular_view_engine](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/angular_view_engine)

## React

Similar to the explanation above for Angular, Bazel is agnostic to what tools you choose to run on your project.
However, the benefits of using Bazel are unlocked as you adopt it as your build system.
We think the following examples show a typical migration of adopting Bazel:

**create-react-app**: If you run `create-react-app`, it will install a build system called `react-scripts`.
As a first step into Bazel, you can simply ask Bazel to wrap the existing build system.
This guarantees compatibility with your current code, and if your objective is just to include a frontend app into
a bigger full-stack Bazel build, this might be the final step in the migration.
However it will run `react-scripts` as a single Bazel action, which means that you gain no incrementality benefit.
So we expect for most applications this is just a first step.

The [create-react-app example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/create-react-app)
shows how this will look. We suggest reading the README in that example, and also look at the commit history to that
directory as an illustration of how we started from create-react-app and added Bazel bits.

**cra-eject**: As a next step to make our Build more incremental and performant, we follow the create-react-app suggestion
of "ejecting" the configuration. This means the `react-scripts` build system is gone, and Bazel can take its place.

TODO(alexeagle): build an example illustrating how this looks

**custom**: If you really know your JS build tools, Bazel is the perfect way to assemble all the myriad individual tools
into a custom toolchain. This allows you to unlock any part of the JS ecosystem without waiting for it to be integrated
for you by maintainers of a project like create-react-app, who have a very high bar for adding features since the
maintenance and support burden falls on them. However you'll need to understand both the tools as well as Bazel to
successfully build your own toolchain.

There is a basic example at [examples/react_webpack](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/react_webpack) but it needs a lot more work to show everything that is possible!

## Vue

We don't have a dedicated example yet, but Vue has been known to work. Follow https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1840 for an example.

## Svelte

None yet, please file an issue if you need this.

# Test Runners

## Jest

There is a dedicated example for Jest: [examples/jest](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/jest)

## Cypress

We have done some early work to run Cypress under Bazel. Follow https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1904 for an example.

## Mocha

Example at [examples/webapp](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/webapp) has a simple `mocha_test`

## Karma and Protractor

See Protractor usage in [examples/app](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/blob/master/examples/app/)

# Bundlers

## Webpack

See [examples/react_webpack](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/react_webpack)

## Rollup

The example at [examples/webapp](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/webapp) uses Rollup, and produces an app with ES5 and ES2015 variants ("differential loading") that gives faster loading in modern browsers without dropping support for legacy ones.

## Parcel

The example in [examples/parcel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/parcel) shows how to write a custom rule, it happens to use the parcel binary to build. It's a very minimal example but might be enough to get you started. 

# Language tooling

## LESS, Sass, Stylus

See styles directory inside the [examples/app](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/app/styles) example.

## TypeScript

Most of the examples show TypeScript usage. Also look in [packages/typescript/test](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/packages/typescript/test) for lots of handling of edge cases.

## Kotlin

The Kotlin language can compile to JS. The result has a very large stdlib JS payload, so we don't recommend this for most uses.

Example at [examples/kotlin](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/kotlin)

## Google Closure Compiler

[rules_closure](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure) is a whole-cloth approach to using Bazel if you're fully bought-into the Closure ecosystem.

[examples/closure](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/closure) shows a very simple way to call the closure compiler without jumping into that ecosystem.

## Protocol Buffers and gRPC

Note: this is considered a "labs" feature in rules_nodejs, so support and stability are not great. gRPC is still a WIP.

See [examples/protocol_buffers](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/protocol_buffers)

# Bazel-specific

## Bazel Persistent Workers

If you want to speed up Bazel by keeping some tools running warm in the background as daemons, there's a good readme in the [examples/worker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/tree/master/examples/worker)
