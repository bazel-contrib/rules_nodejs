# Developing on the docsite

Running locally can be done with Jekyll via bazel.
Follow setup instructions at https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

You'll also need the `jekyll-toc` gem installed

To build and update the docs in the `/docs` folder, run

```sh
$ yarn stardoc
```

To serve the docsite locally, use
```sh
$ bazel run //docs
```

# Authoring the docsite

The docsite is a mix of stardoc generated markdown and hand written markdown.  
The files marked with 
```
<!-- *********************
 DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
  It is a generated build output from Stardoc.
  Instead you must edit the .bzl file where the rules are declared,
  or possibly a markdown file next to the .bzl file
 ********************* -->
 ```

Should be edited by modifying the docs in the source `.bzl` files.
If updating css, then the `scss` in `/docs/css` should be edited.
The HTML files in `/docs` are also generated and should not be edited directly, other files can be freely edited.
