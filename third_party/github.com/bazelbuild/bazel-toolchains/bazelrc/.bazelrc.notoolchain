# This .bazelrc file contains some  of the flags required for the provided
# toolchain with Remote Build Execution. Specifically, it includes all flags
# except toolchain/platform flags.

# Depending on how many machines are in the remote execution instance, setting
# this higher can make builds faster by allowing more jobs to run in parallel.
# Setting it too high can result in jobs that timeout, however, while waiting
# for a remote machine to execute them.
build:remote --jobs=50

# Set various strategies so that all actions execute remotely. Mixing remote
# and local execution will lead to errors unless the toolchain and remote
# machine exactly match the host machine.
