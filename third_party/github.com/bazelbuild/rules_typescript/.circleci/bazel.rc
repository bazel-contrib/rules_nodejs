# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.

# Don't be spammy in the logs
build --noshow_progress

# Don't run manual tests
test --test_tag_filters=-manual

# Print all the options that apply to the build.
# This helps us diagnose which options override others
# (e.g. /etc/bazel.bazelrc vs. tools/bazel.rc)
build --announce_rc

# Enable experimental CircleCI bazel remote cache proxy
build --experimental_remote_spawn_cache --remote_rest_cache=http://localhost:7643

# Prevent unstable environment variables from tainting cache keys
build --experimental_strict_action_env

# Save downloaded repositories such as the go toolchain
# This directory can then be included in the CircleCI cache
# It should save time running the first build

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming 3072M of RAM
