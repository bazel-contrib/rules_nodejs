**This is an alpha-quality release. Breaking changes are likely.**

The nodejs rules integrate NodeJS development and runtime with bazel.

## Installation

First, install a current bazel distribution, following the [bazel instructions].

Create a `BUILD.bazel` file in your project root:

```python
package(default_visibility = ["//visibility:public"])

# NOTE: this will move to node_modules/BUILD in a later release
filegroup(name = "node_modules", srcs = glob(["node_modules/**/*"]))
```

Next create a `WORKSPACE` file in your project root (or edit the existing one)
containing:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

git_repository(
    name = "build_bazel_rules_nodejs",
    remote = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs.git",
    tag = "0.1.0", # check for the latest tag when you install
)

load("@build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:defs.bzl", "node_repositories")

# NOTE: this rule installs nodejs, npm, and yarn, but does NOT install
# your npm dependencies. You must still run the package manager.
node_repositories(package_json = ["//:package.json"])
```

You must now run the package manager to install the npm dependencies.

We recommend using the Yarn package manager, because it has a built-in command
to verify the integrity of your `node_modules` directory.
You can run the version Bazel has already installed:

```sh
$ bazel run @yarn//:yarn
```

If you use npm instead, run:

```sh
$ bazel run @nodejs//:npm install
```

# Usage

Currently, the only available rule is `nodejs_binary` which allows you to run an application, either from sources you author or from those fetched from npm.

## Running a program from npm
If you have installed the [rollup] package, you could write this rule:

```python
load("@build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:defs.bzl", "nodejs_binary")

nodejs_binary(
    name = "rollup",
    entry_point = "rollup/bin/rollup",
)
```

and run it with

```sh
$ bazel run :rollup -- --help
```

[rollup]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup

## Running a program from local sources

```python
load("@build_bazel_rules_nodejs//:defs.bzl", "nodejs_binary")

nodejs_binary(
    name = "example",
    data = [
        "@//:node_modules",
        "main.js",
    ],
    entry_point = "workspace_name/main.js",
    args = ["--node_options=--expose-gc"],
)
```

This example illustrates how to pass arguments to nodejs (as opposed to passing arguments to the program).

The `data` attribute is optional, by default it includes the `node_modules` directory. To include your own
sources, include a file or target that produces JavaScript.

# Design

Most bazel rules include package management. That is, the `WORKSPACE` file installs your dependencies as well as the toolchain. In some environments, this is the normal workflow, for example in Java, Gradle and Maven are each both a build tool and a package manager.

In nodejs, there are a variety of package managers and build tools which can interoperate. Also, there is a well-known package installation location (`node_modules` directory in your project). Command-line and other tools look in this directory to find packages. So we must either download packages twice (risking version skew between them) or point all tools to Bazel's `external` directory with `NODE_PATH` which would be very inconvenient.

Instead, our philosophy is: in the NodeJS ecosystem, Bazel is only a build tool. It is up to the user to install packages into their `node_modules` directory, though the build tool can verify the contents.

## Hermeticity and reproducibility

Bazel generally guarantees builds are correct with respect to their inputs. For example, this means that given the same source tree, you can re-build the same artifacts as an earlier release of your program. In the nodejs rules, Bazel is not the package manager, so some reponsibility falls to the developer to avoid builds that use the wrong dependencies. This problem exists with any build system in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Both NPM and Yarn have a lockfile, which ensures that dependencies only change when the lockfile changes. Users are *strongly encouraged* to use the locking mechanism in their package manager.

- npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json
- yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/yarn-lock/

Note that https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1 will take the guarantee further: by using the lockfile as an input to Bazel, the nodejs rules can verify the integrity of the dependencies. This would make it impossible for a build to be non-reproducible, so long as you have the same lockfile.
