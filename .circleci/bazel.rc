# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.

# Don't be spammy in the logs
build --noshow_progress

# Print all the options that apply to the build.
# This helps us diagnose which options override others

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming resources that fit in CircleCI "xlarge" class

# Let's give all failing tests a second try to mostly paper over flakiness
